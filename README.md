# Eye Gender Predicctor
Predict Gender from Eye Morphology Using CNN

## Introduction
Here, we have created a custom CNN architecture loosely based off of ResNet that is used in order to predict gender of an image subject using eye morphology. The architecture used consists of a Deep CNN architecture that is bolstered by the use of Data Augmentation and Skip Connections.

## Data
The data, present in `eye_gender_data.zip` consists of a Training set with labelled images and a test set with unlabelled images. The images are photos of eyes with an associated male or female label.
